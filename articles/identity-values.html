            <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the

            <p>
                I don't know whether I'm lucky or not for not being involved into a serious ethical situation. 
                In my home country befoe coming to NZ, I used to a frequent customer for a cafe. I take my laptop
                and continue working alone in a place that I can zone off with no distractions. In many occasions, I leave
                the place without paying the bill, sometime, I just completey forget. The next visit, I go to the waiter and sincerely
                apologise and explain that I it was a mistake and I was zoned off.
                Everytime it happens I make the right thing by apologising and paying off my overdue bills.
            </p>
            <h2>

            <p>
               Alcohol in my religion is forbidden. In all my life, I have never had an alcoholic drink.
               From where I come, drinking is legally not allowed, however people find ways to drink occasionally.
               Coming here to NZ was a little shock to me. Drinking is accepted in social gatherings such as weddings, celebrations, christmas.
               Friends have always offered and tried to pursuade me to try it once for the experience but my response is always the same. I respect
               my religion and my faith and that's who I am. I don't feel I'm missing something and I believe drinking will gain any benefit, 
               like making me look cool for others.
