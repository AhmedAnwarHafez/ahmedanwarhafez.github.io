                <p><strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
                        core
                        learning?</strong></p>
                <p>There are two things that I&#39;ve learned about myself at the start of the bootcamp. First, I enjoy
                    teaching and explaining programming to other students who are completely new to the programming.
                    Second, I&#39;m patient when teaching and helping others when they struggle understanding complex
                    programming topics. I feel satisfied when I see my fellow students get this AH-HA moment after being
                    frustrated. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, I had one of these moments during the bootcamp when I felt hard on myself. I felt
                    that
                    my human skills are not good enough, especially leadership skills. However, after practicing
                    meditation
                    for many sessions, I try to push these negative thoughts away and stay positive and focused on
                    learning
                    journey.</p>

                <p><strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>When I worked with my teammates during One-day projects, I learned that my values are not always the
                    same as my teammates.
                    In many times, I wanted to deliver at least a working product but other teammates wanted to learn
                    and
                    enjoy the process.</p>
                Learning and knowing their values helps to communicate and understand what drives them. </p>
                <p>After learning empathy in the human skills lessons, I learned that empathy can make us accept
                    ourselves and others as well.
                    Showing empathy provides a sense of validation and kindness no matter how different we are.</p>

                <p><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong></p>
                <p>Core learning helped me to understand and know values I had that I&#39;ve never thought about them
                    before.
                    Knowing and understanding my values helps me to utilise my strength points and manage my weaknesses.

            <section>
                <p><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong></p>
                <p>The most challenging thing is to practice and apply what I&#39;ve learned so far in my life and at
                    work.

                <p><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                        learning in
                        a web development bootcamp course?</strong></p>
                <p>Software development is not entirely about writing software, it&#39;s about communincating with
                    teams,
                    domain experts, non-techinical people.
                    Core learning is a key aspect to any successful project.</p>

            <section>
                <p><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                        have
                        just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></p>
                <p>I signed up for this course primarly to learn about human skills and apply all this knowledge with
                    other
                    students.</p>
