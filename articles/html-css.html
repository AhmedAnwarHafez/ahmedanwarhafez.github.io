            <h1>The Difference between Margin and Padding</h1>
            <p>In this article, we're going to explore the difference between Margin and Padding.
                But first we'll take a quick look at The CSS Box Model layout in order to understand how Margin and
                Padding work and when to use each.</p>
            <h2>Art Display</h2>
            <p>I would like explain the The CSS Box Model using an analogy.
            Art exhibitions will be my Analogy.
            </p>
            <p>Take a look at the photo below. </p>

                Notice the negative space between the painting and the wooden frame, and the negative space between the frames.
                The whitespace marked in green are called padding in CSS nad Padding is the space that sits between the content (the painting in this analogy) and border (the wooden frame).
                The whitespace marked in red are called marigin and it's the space that sits between the border and the border of other elements. In our example, it's the space between two frames.
