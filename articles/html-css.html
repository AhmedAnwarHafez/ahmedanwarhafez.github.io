            <h1>The Difference between Margin and Padding</h1>
            <p>In this short blog post, we're going to see the difference between CSS Margin and CSS Padding using
                images. I'm going to use art exhibitions as an example to show the difference.</p>
            <h2>Art Display</h2>
            <p>Art paintings, in any exhibition, are placed on walls and each painting is separated with some space as
                in the photo below. </p>
            <img width="500px" src="./html-css/two-paintings.jpg" />
            <p>
                The photo above shows two paintings.
                There are a few things to notice in this photo. The paintings are framed and there is a visible
                whitespace between the edge of the paintings and the edge of the wooden frame.
                There is a small space between the frames.
                The painting on the right has more whitespace than the two other paintings.
            </p>
            <h2>Margin, Padding and Border</h2>
            <img width="500px" src="./html-css/margin-and-padding.jpg" />
            <p>
                The space between the painting and the edge of the frame (marked in green) is called padding in CSS.
                <br />
                The space separating both frames (marked in red) is called Margin. Do you see the difference now?
                The wooden frame in CSS is the equivalent of Border.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is how you set these three properties in CSS.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <br>
                .class-for-any-content {
                    margin: 10px;
                    padding: 10px;
                    border-color: black;
                    border-width: 2px;
                }
                <br>
            </pre>
            <div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div></div>
    </div>
</body>
