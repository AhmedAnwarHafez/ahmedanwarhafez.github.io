**What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?**
There are two things that I've learned about myself at the start of the bootcamp. First, I enjoy teaching and explaining programming to other students who are completely new to the programming. 
Second, I'm patient when teaching and helping others when they struggle understanding complex programming topics. I feel satisfied when I see my fellow students get this AH-HA moment after being frustrated. 

On the other hand, I had one of these moments during the bootcamp when I felt hard on myself. I felt that my human skills are not good enough, especially leadership skills. However, after practicing meditation for many sessions, I try to push these negative thoughts away and stay positive and focused on learning journey.

**What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?**
When I worked with my teammates during One-day projects, I learned that my values are not always the same as my teammates.
In many times, I wanted to deliver at least a working product but other teammates wanted to learn and enjoy the process.
Learning and knowing their values helps to communicate and understand what drives them. 

**After learning empathy in the human skills lessons, I learned that empathy can make us accept ourselves and others as well.**
Showing empathy provides a sense of validation and kindness no matter how different we are.

**What has surprised you the most about the core learning?**
Core learning helped me to understand and know values I had that I've never thought about them before.
Knowing and understanding my values helps me to utilise my strength points and manage my weaknesses.


**What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?**
The most challenging thing is to practice and apply what I've learned so far in my life and at work.

**Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?**
Software development is not entirely about writing software, it's about communincating with teams, domain experts, non-techinical people.
Core learning is a key aspect to any successful project.

**Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.**
I signed up for this course primarly to learn about human skills and apply all this knowledge with other students.
