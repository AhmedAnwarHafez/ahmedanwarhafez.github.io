                <h2>Differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
                <p>If were to explain HTML to a non techinical person I would say writing HTML is similar to building
                    constructing a house. A house has is made of columns, walls, beam, brick and a roof. These are the
                    basic
                    building basic.
                    <br>
                    After completion, comes next painting and decoration. This is the step which gives the soul or
                    character to buildings.
                    One cannot start painting a wall if there is no wall already, right?
                    So the first step when developing a webpage is to start writing HTML first, then stylise, format and
                    colorise HTML elements next.

                <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
                <p>Control Flow and Loops are most basic and important foundations for any programming language. Any
                    simple meaningful program must at least has control flow, loops or both.
                    Let's consider this simple analogy before explaining Control Flow and Loops.
                    Imagine a school teacher who gaves his students a paper exam with one true-false question.
                    The teacher grabs a pile of exams on his right and picks the exam for some student for grading, he
                    looks at the answer and gives a point if the answer is true or no point if the answer is false.
                    The next step is he puts the paper to hid left side. Then he grabs the next paper from the pile on
                    his right. Teacher A repeats these steps until there are no papers to grade.
                    If you think about it for a moment you'll that the process of grading the exam is very mechanical
                    and systematic and can be programmed.
                    There are collection of things that we want to process until some kind of condition is met in order
                    to terminate. If the answer is correct then a point is given, else do nothing.
                    IF Conditions is one of most common used control flows and it tells the computer to either process
                    or skip a computation based on a condition.
                    In our example, the condition is either the student has provided the correct answer or not.
                    Since there are a collection of things to process (exam answers), we need a loop to traverse the
                    collection.
                    There are two ways of achieving this and here is a psuedo-code:

                <ul>
                    <li>Using a for-loop</li>
                    <pre>
                    for (i=0; i <= answers.length; i++) {
                        const current = answers[i];
                        if (current == true) {
                            // give one point
                        } else {
                            // do nothing
                        }
                    }
                    </pre>
                    <li>
                        Using a while-loop
                    <pre>
                    while (end_of_test(answers) == false) {
                        const current = answers[i];
                        if (current == true) {
                            // give one point
                        } else {
                            // do nothing
                        }
                    }
                    </pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
