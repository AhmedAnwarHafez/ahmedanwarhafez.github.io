            <h3>Describe your core personal values.</h3>
            <p>
                I once heard a powerful quote long time ago that truely reasonated with me.
            </p>
            <i>If you do not add something to life, you will be more than it. -Mostafa Al-Refaai </i>
            <p>
                I remember that time when I hearded it and struck me like a lightning and it kept me wondering and
                reflecting about my life till this day.
                Have I added something useful to my life and others? Did I add enough? Did I make a difference? Am I
                satisfied leaving a good legacy to my life?
                All these questions come to my mind from time to time when I remember that quote.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, working in the software industry for many years has made feel that I've added or
                contributed something to life.
                I feel satisfied and fulfilled after I deploy a piece of software to a client that it will make
                someone's life better.
                Adding positive value to life (of any kind) is in itself a very important value to myself.
                There is no specific value that really defines me. I think I like to embrace a collection of values.
                For example, listening and supporting others, giving charity to people who are in need, giving genuine
                compliments.
            </p>

            <h3>Strengths & Limits</h3>
            <p>I enjoy being curious and enthusiastic when learn new stuff everyday regardless whether it's about programming or technology.
                Topics such as psychology, history, astronomy or film making are my favourite topics that interest.
                The ability to constantly learn enabled me to be adaptable in this fast moving industry and was a key trait for myself.
                <br>
               One of my limits that affects me from time to time is procrastination. Since I've started working remotely from home and the lack of being surronded
               by people is the main reason why I procrastinate from time to time. I think with right mentanlity and motivation I can overcome it.
               Also practicing mindful meditation should help me to be self-aware and recognise it when it happens.
            </p>
            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>
                Alcohol in my religion is forbidden. In all my life, I have never had an alcoholic drink.
                From where I come, drinking is legally not allowed, however people find ways to drink occasionally.
                Coming here to NZ was a little shock to me. Drinking is accepted in social gatherings such as weddings,
                celebrations, christmas.
                Friends have always offered and tried to pursuade me to try it once for the experience but my response
                is always the same. I respect
                my religion and my faith and that's who I am. I don't feel I'm missing something and I believe drinking
                will gain any benefit,
                like making me look cool for others.
